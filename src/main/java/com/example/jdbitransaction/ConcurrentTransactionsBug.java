     * Demonstrates how one thread steals a transaction from another thread.
     * This is caused by a buggy lookup in {@link io.micronaut.configuration.jdbi.transaction.micronaut.MicronautDataTransactionHandler#getTransactionStatus}
     * Since it uses Handle as a key for Lookup. Handles for the same Jdbi injectable Bean use the
     * SAME instance of ContextualConnection and its {@link Handle#equals(Object)} compares the Jdbi
     * (is the same) and Connection (is the SAME instance) for all Handles created by Jdbi instance.
     *
     * Therefore, queries like isInTransaction() and other operations of MicronautDataTransactionHandler
     * are likely to mix threads together.
     *
     * Timing is critical. A transactionless query must start before a concurrent transaction
     * on the same Connection starts, and must end before that concurrent transaction commits.
     * To do so, we use Semaphores to establish that timing.
     * The offspring thread executes first, and its RowMapper releases this main thread to
     * create the transanction. The main thread stops and is released only after the
     *

     * FIRST modifies {@link io.micronaut.core.propagation.PropagatedContext} so it ("A") one lists NO

     * AFTER the supplied returns, the Scope "B" that could restore suspended connection is added to
     * synchronizations; it will be ordered AFTER "A", and therefore rolled back first on connection
     * complete. So instead restoring PropagatedContext in the order "A", "B", the states will be
     * restored in the order "B", "A", leaving incorrect state after closing the connection returned
     * by suspendOpenConnection().
     *
     * In addition, if obtaining a new connection fails (i.e. pool exhausted etc), suspendOpenConnection
     * FAILS to restore the previous context, as Scope is not rolled back in finally, it is not added
     * to connection synchronizations.
